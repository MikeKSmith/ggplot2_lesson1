# Learner person for this ggplot2 lesson

Scott is a manager in the Pharmacometrics group at a multinational pharmaceutical 
company with 6 colleagues reporting into him. He has used R for over 10 years and
is very familiar with base R and how to create plots using it. He would like to 
be able to review and QC ggplot2 code that his direct reports have prepared but 
would also like to prepare some graphs using ggplot2 for his own work. He doesn't 
have much time to troubleshoot making these graphs - he needs to be productive 
with ggplot2 quickly.

This lesson will help Scott get started with ggplot2 and allow him to create useful
graphs in 15 minutes. We'll focus on functionality that Scott is likely to use 
frequently.

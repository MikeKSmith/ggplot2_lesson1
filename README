README!

Thanks for looking at this lesson on "Getting started with ggplot2". It's designed for 
somebody who is quite familiar with base R, but hasn't yet started using ggplot2. 

Within our domain (pharmacometrics) the most typical plot we see is time-course of 
some biological measurement e.g. plasma concentration of some drug within 
subjects. So the aim of this lesson is to get up to speed quickly with plotting
this kind of data.

Follow the instructions in the .Rmd file and fill in the blank spaces in the R 
chunks, then run the chunk using the green arrow button or CTRL/CMD + ENTER.

Once you have completed all the chunks you can render the output as HTML or PDF
using the "knit" button / drop down menu.
